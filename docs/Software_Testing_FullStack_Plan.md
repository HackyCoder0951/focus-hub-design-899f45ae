# Focus Hub – Full Stack Testing Plan

## 1. Objectives
- Ensure all layers (frontend, backend, API, database, integrations) function as intended
- Detect defects early and prevent regressions
- Validate user experience, data integrity, security, and performance

---

## 2. Scope
- **Frontend:** UI components, user flows, client-side logic
- **Backend/API:** REST endpoints, authentication, business logic
- **Database:** Data integrity, migrations, RLS (Row Level Security)
- **Integrations:** Supabase, AI services, real-time features
- **End-to-End:** User journeys across the stack

---

## 3. Test Types & Coverage
| Layer      | Test Type                | Description/Examples                                  |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend   | Unit, Integration, E2E   | Component tests, form validation, navigation, UI flows |
| Backend    | Unit, Integration        | API logic, auth, error handling, business rules        |
| API        | Contract, Integration    | Endpoint responses, error codes, schema validation     |
| Database   | Migration, Data, RLS     | Schema changes, data constraints, access policies      |
| Integration| Service, Real-time, AI   | Supabase sync, AI answer flow, chat, notifications     |
| E2E        | User Journey             | Register-login-post, chat, Q&A, resource upload        |

---

## 4. Tools & Frameworks
- **Frontend:** Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress
- **Backend/API:** Jest, Supertest, Postman
- **Database:** Supabase CLI, SQL scripts, pgTAP (optional)
- **E2E:** Cypress, Playwright
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (or similar)

---

## 5. Environments
- **Local Development:** For rapid feedback
- **Staging:** Pre-production, mirrors production data and config
- **Production:** For smoke and monitoring tests only

---

## 6. Roles & Responsibilities
| Role         | Responsibilities                                  |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Developer    | Write/maintain unit, integration, E2E tests       |
| QA Engineer  | Manual/exploratory testing, test case management  |
| DevOps       | Maintain CI/CD, test environments, reporting      |
| Product Owner| Approve test coverage, review critical flows      |

---

## 7. Test Workflow
1. **Test Planning:**
   - Review features, update test documentation
   - Identify new/changed test cases
2. **Test Development:**
   - Write/maintain automated and manual tests
   - Peer review for critical/complex tests
3. **Test Execution:**
   - Run tests locally and in CI/CD on every PR/merge
   - Manual exploratory testing for new features
4. **Defect Reporting:**
   - Log bugs in issue tracker (with steps, screenshots, logs)
5. **Regression Testing:**
   - Re-run full suite before releases
6. **Reporting:**
   - Summarize results in PRs, dashboards, or release notes

## 9. Sample Implementation Steps
### A. Frontend
- Write unit tests for components (Jest/RTL)
- Write integration tests for forms, navigation
- Write E2E tests for user flows (Cypress)

### B. Backend/API
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Write integration tests for endpoints (Supertest)
- Validate API contracts (OpenAPI, Postman)

### C. Database
- Test migrations on a fresh DB
- Validate RLS policies (Supabase dashboard/SQL)
- Use test data scripts for setup/teardown

### D. Integration
- Mock/fake external services in tests
- Test real-time features (Supabase, WebSockets)
- Test AI answer flow (mock/fake AI if needed)

### E. End-to-End
- Automate critical user journeys (register, login, post, chat, Q&A, upload)
- Run E2E tests in CI on every PR/merge

---

## 10. Reporting & Continuous Improvement
- Use CI dashboards for test results
- Track code coverage (aim for >80% on core logic)
- Review and update test cases with every release
- Encourage a culture of testing and quality

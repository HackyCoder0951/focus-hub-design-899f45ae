## Q&A Page â€“ AI Answer Integration

The Q&A page features integrated AI-powered answer generation. Users can:
- Instantly generate AI answers for posted questions
- Regenerate, copy, and rate AI answers
- Benefit from fast, cost-effective, and privacy-focused AI models (Groq)

**Workflow:**
- Users request an AI-generated answer for any question
- The backend calls Groq API, stores the answer, and displays it in the Q&A interface
- Users can provide feedback, copy, or regenerate the AI answer

For setup and customization, see [AI Integration Setup](../AI_INTEGRATION_SETUP.md).

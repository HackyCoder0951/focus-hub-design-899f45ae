# API Layer

## Introduction
The API Layer acts as the bridge between the frontend application and the backend database, handling all data operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources. It abstracts the complexity of direct database access and enforces business logic and security.

## Data Flow Diagram Context
```mermaid

    participant Frontend
    participant API
    participant Database
    Frontend->>API: Send request (e.g., create post)
    API->>Database: Perform operation (insert/update/delete)
    Database-->>API: Return result
    API-->>Frontend: Send response
```

## Use Cases Diagram Context
```mermaid

  actor Frontend
  Frontend --> (Create Resource)
  Frontend --> (Read Resource)
  Frontend --> (Update Resource)
  Frontend --> (Delete Resource)
  Frontend --> (Integrate with External Service)
```

## Database Design
```mermaid

  api_layer ||--o{ posts : ""
  api_layer ||--o{ comments : ""
  api_layer ||--o{ votes : ""
  api_layer ||--o{ answers : ""
```

The API Layer ensures all data operations are secure, validated, and consistent across the application.
